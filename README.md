# The Chronicles Of Myrtana: Archolos Decompilation

This repository contains a decompilation of the main Daedalus script included in the [The Chronicles Of Myrtana: Archolos](https://kronikimyrtany.pl/en/) mod. It is intended for research to achive compatibility with [Ikarus](https://github.com/Lehona/Ikarus)/[LeGo](https://github.com/Lehona/LeGo) in [OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic).

This decompilation has many syntax errors and is probably missing a lot of code. It is not intended to be re-compilable. In case you are wondering, the script was decompiled using my `zscript` tool, found in [phoenix-studio](https://github.com/lmichaelis/phoenix-studio). If you are a developer of _Chronicles Of Myrtana_ and you're not comfortable with this repository, please contact me through the means detailed on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lmichaelis#-how-to-get-in-touch).

If you'd like to explore this repository, I'd recommend using the [vscode-daedalus extension](https://github.com/kirides/vscode-daedalus) by [kirides](https://github.com/kirides).
